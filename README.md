# PhysicsSimulator
Graphic interface to visualize the effects of a physics simulator over certain bodies.

Project done in Programming Technology II during my second year at university.
The main concept of the project is to be able to apply forces (gravity, towrads fixed points, rotating over object of bigger mass...) and provide a clean GUI that allows to visualize the consecuences and movements, 
as well as set the forces however you want.
To see an example, execute the main file, click on the top left button and select one of the inputs from the examples folder.
